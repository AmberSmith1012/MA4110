    "Welcome to MA4110: Foundations of Data Science!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",

    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",
